Hi blog, long time no see!

Dunno why I've neglected to post about previous goodies like this, but I've just release a new *free* **Sketch Material Design template** on Dribbble: [https://dribbble.com/shots/2296655-Material-Design-Sketch-Template-v2-Free](https://dribbble.com/shots/2296655-Material-Design-Sketch-Template-v2-Free)

You'll notice I added some device backgrounds for laptop, tablet-landscape, tablet-portrait and mobile. These are behind the actual Sketch artboards so they won't export.

This is an evolution of my previous Material Design Sketch template from over a year ago: [https://dribbble.com/shots/1686164-Material-Design-Free-Sketch-Template-Icons](https://dribbble.com/shots/1686164-Material-Design-Free-Sketch-Template-Icons)

When I designed the original template, there wasn't much out there in terms of specs for Material Design layouts beyond mobile and the one layout I included (card-over).

Since then there were suggested layouts in Angular-Material (my jam), and finally the Polymer team came out with this super cool site for 4 layouts across 3 responsive breakpoints: [http://polymerelements.github.io/app-layout-templates/](http://polymerelements.github.io/app-layout-templates/)
