{% include JB/setup %}

Hey all my Joomla homies (Joomies?), just a heads up that I've moved all the Joomla 3.0 JUI docs and sample markup over to a subdomain since I've moved my main site over to Github pages.

###New location:

Updated 10/07/2013, moved back to the original location:
[http://kyleledbetter.com/jui](http://kyleledbetter.com/jui)

also, Peter van Westen has started a Joomla 3.2 JUI site with the new icons: [http://ndev.nl/jui/](http://ndev.nl/jui/)

Ping me if you have any issues getting to it.
