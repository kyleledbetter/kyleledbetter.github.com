Thanks for stopping by my new experiment. This blog isn't powered by your traditional CMS. If you're from the Joomla, Drupal or Wordpress world this might just blow your mind.

## Built on Github Pages and Jekyll Bootstrap

### I think I've heard of Github Pages, refresh my memory though

Github pages are sites/pages hosted directly from your Github repo. Isn't that cool as hell? You can host a flat html page or make it dynamic with Jekyll. You just need to create a repo that matches your username like username.github.com and push to the master branch, and Github handles the rest! You can of course [point your domain to github](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages).

### Right. What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".

### Ok, then what is Jekyll Bootstrap?

It's exactly what it sounds like. A Bootstrap theme slapped on top of Jekyll. It's got a lot of other [cool features](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

### New Tech & Toys

I've been a web CMS guy for so long (and I still loves me some Joomla), but it was time for a change. I love bleeding-edge tech and always want to try new shiny things. I also have what I call "web-ADHD" (squirrel!). These are probably the reasons I've done well in business and work, but these are also the reasons I had to change. Learning how to build on Github pages, Jekyll and a bit of Ruby has been really fun.

### New Workflows

In Joomla sites I always find myself turning off JCE/TinyMCE throughout writing a blog post. I also think if you need more than markdown in a blog you're probably doint it wrong. Lastly for "static" pages I'd rather develop them offline in Coda 2 or Espresso instead of cramming all that html into a Joomla article. These are many of the reasons I'm thrilled about my new workflow:

1. Write post locally in markdown using [Mou](http://mouapp.com/)
2. Save > Commit > Push to Github master using [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/)
3. Enjoy coffee and/or beer

#### Bonus: Free Hosting & Backups
Oh yeah, Github happens to be a versioned repository and hosting is free.

### Shortcomings (had to be some right?)
I can't figure out how to order the damn left nav! :)
