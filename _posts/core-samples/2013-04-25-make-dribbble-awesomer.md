It's been a while (not like the Staind song). Thought I'd share a couple of Chrome extensions I use every day that Dribbble even better.

## Benchwarmer

Benchwarmer commandeers your default Chrome tab and injects Dribbble goodness in its place. It's got infinite scroll and you can log in to see your Following shots.

[Install Benchwarmer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/benchwarmer-dribbble-tab/lhdjhhpjicomphhjpehdhjenbaamdpnn) from [Tiny Factor](http://www.tinyfactory.co/).

## Dribbble HD

Ever wish the Dribbble shots were larger while browsing? You're not alone. Dribbble HD cleverly takes advantage of the 2x image sizes and loads them instead, for 2 bigger columns of "HD" loveliness.

[Install Dribbble HD](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dribbble-hd/ichgbbciejbjechpkakbegaaenamkpib) from Darsain.

#### Bonus: Flipboard App
Since I must have my Dribbble fix around the clock, I consume it via the iOS app on my iPad and iPhone whenever I'm away from my desk. I actually prefer this over any other Dribbble-specific apps (I've tried them all).

[iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard-your-social-news/id358801284?mt=8)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flipboard.app&hl=en)

The Android version looks nearly identical as well.

### Got any other tips to make Dribbble awesomer?
